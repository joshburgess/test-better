# Changelog

All notable changes to `test-better` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Per PROJECT_BUILD_PLAN.md §3 and §16, **every public API change is recorded under
`## [Unreleased]` before the PR that introduces it is merged.** All crates are
versioned in lockstep until 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Phase 0 scaffolding: workspace with eight member crates, pinned toolchain
  (`1.95.0`), lint and format configuration, CI matrix, dual licensing, and
  contribution docs. No public API yet.
- `test-better-core`: `TestError` failure type with `ErrorKind`, `ContextFrame`,
  and `Payload`. `Display`/`Debug` render a pretty failure message and the
  `std::error::Error` impl walks the wrapped-error source chain (Iteration 1.1).
- `test-better-core`: `StructuredError` (with `SourceLocation`,
  `StructuredContextFrame`, `StructuredPayload`) and `TestError::to_structured`,
  the owned/serializable form tooling consumes. An optional `serde` feature
  derives `Serialize`/`Deserialize` on the structured types (Iteration 1.1).

### Notes

- `TestError` carries a dedicated `message: Option<Cow<'static, str>>` field, a
  deliberate deviation from the struct sketched in PROJECT_BUILD_PLAN.md §6.1:
  the message answers *what* failed, context frames answer *while doing what*.
  See the type's rustdoc for rationale.
- `clippy.toml` gained `allow-panic-in-tests = true`, completing the
  "allowed in tests" intent of PROJECT_BUILD_PLAN.md §3 (Phase 0 set only the
  unwrap/expect equivalents).
